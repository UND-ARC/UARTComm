# New Repository Template

This repository is home to the code/libraries that are responsible for communications between devices on the rocket.

Under the `src` folder there is a folder for each device containing the code that runs on that device.  For example, under `src/arduino`, there is a sketch with the code to communicate over necessary mediums.
